Please explain any unusual elements of your solution here or what you
did for extra credit.  (Extra credit is not necessary.)

Introduction: We implemented all of the regular assignment and also 
did a bit of extra credit. The regular assignment is described in 
part I. and the extra credit is described in part II.  

I. The Normal Assignment 
All of PiMain, BoolMain, and LamMain are executables that show the 
abilities of Pi.hs, BoolExp.hs, and Lam.hs, respectively. 

To execute all these, you can do the following commands:

$ make clean
$ make
$ ./PiMain
$ ./BoolMain
$ ./LamMain

In between these commands, you will see printouts of the tests 
being executed and their final answers. 

II. The Extra Credit

For the extra credit, we implemented Natural Expressions and 
their ability to add, multiply, and use variables. 

The files related to the extra credit are: NatExp.hs, and NatMain.hs

(Note that the Makefile already makes NatMain for you and all you
need to do is execute NatMain after 'make'-ing)

To execute NatMain, you can do the following commands:

$ make clean
$ make
$ ./NatMain

This command will make a few tests execute. 

While the extra credit recommendations in Final.pdf suggested using 'X'
to denote each unit number, we used '#' instead, and each one is printed
in a new line. Therefore:

#

#
#

is equal to 4.
