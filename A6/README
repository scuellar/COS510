Introduction: We implemented all of the regular assignment and also 
did a bit of extra credit. The regular assignment is described in 
part I. and the extra credit is described in part II.  

I. The Normal Assignment 
All of PiMain, BoolMain, and LamMain are executables that show the abilities of Pi.hs, BoolExp.hs, and Lam.hs, respectively. 

To execute all these, you can do the following commands:

$ make clean
$ make
$ ./PiMain
$ ./BoolMain
$ ./LamMain

In between these commands, you will see printouts of the tests being executed and their final answers. 

II. The Extra Credit
